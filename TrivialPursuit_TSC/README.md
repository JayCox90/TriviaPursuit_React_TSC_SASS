# Trivial Pursuit with React, Typescript and SASS

This is an adaption of one of the exercises I did during the Constructor Academy Bootcamp, only this time doing it with Typescript and Sass.

It is almost fully responsive, only aspect I did not fix 100% is mobile in landscape mode. But otherwise it should be responsive enough :)

Basically, this is a personal refersh on sass and how to use Typescript with React and Redux
